# Vrane – K-12  (MVP)

Vrane is a web app for **K-12 students** that helps them understand while reading.

A student:
1. Opens a reading passage.
2. **Highlights** any text (e.g. “kindergarten through 12th grade”).
3. Immediately gets a **simple, kid-friendly explanation** generated by AI.

The goal is to let students learn at their own pace, while giving schools and teachers a tool that fits into existing platforms.

---

## 🌟 Main Features

- Web-based reading interface (works on laptop, tablet, Chromebook).
- Highlight any part of the text → get a simple explanation.
- AI explanations tailored for **K-12 reading level**.

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture (Textual Diagram)

Below is a **plain-text architecture diagram** for how the system works:

```text
[ Student Browser (Web App) ]
          |
          | 1. Student opens passage and highlights text
          v
[ Frontend (React / Next.js / Vite) ]
          |
          | 2. Sends selected phrase + context via HTTPS (JSON)
          v
[ Backend API (Node.js / TypeScript, Express or similar) ]
          |
          | 3. Builds a safe prompt for K-12 students
          | 4. Calls OpenAI API with the phrase + context
          v
[ OpenAI / LLM Provider ]
          |
          | 5. Returns a kid-friendly explanation
          v
[ Backend API ]
          |
          | 6. Sends explanation back as JSON
          v
[ Frontend ]
          |
          | 7. Shows explanation panel under the highlighted text
          v
[ Student reads and continues ]

```

## Data & future components:

PostgreSQL / other DB (later):

Store schools, classes, students, passages, usage logs.

Auth provider (later):

Google / school SSO, teacher & student roles.

Analytics (later):

Which phrases are hardest, which students need extra support.

##  Tech Stack (Planned / Current)

## Frontend:

React (with Vite or Next.js)

TypeScript (optional but recommended)

Tailwind CSS or simple CSS for styling

## Backend API:

Node.js (18+)

Express / Next.js API routes / Vercel Serverless Functions

TypeScript (optional)

## AI / LLM:

OpenAI API (e.g. gpt-4o-mini for explanations) Price-wise best initially 

## Deployment (MVP):

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Vercel functions / Render / Railway / similar

## Step by Step – workflow

Student opens the website and sees a reading passage.

The student highlights a word or phrase.

The browser (frontend) detects the selected text and sends it to the backend API.

The backend takes:

the selected phrase,

the full sentence/passage,the student grade level (if available),and builds a prompt for the OpenAI API.

The OpenAI model returns a short, simple explanation.

The backend sends that explanation back to the browser.

The browser shows the explanation in a panel below the text so the student can keep reading.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
